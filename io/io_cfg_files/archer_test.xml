<!--  Please enter any necessary conditions for the use of this file here. 

   1.  This control file uses the configuration-defined 'diagnostic_file' parameters to direct 
       and name diagnostic files.

   2.  To write to multiple files, create multiple unique parameters in the configuration for 
       directing and naming each file, and use them in unique file blocks within data-writing.

   3.  MONC's IO_server can be unstable with regard to certain combinations of diagnostics
       being written to the same file.  Often, this sensitivity will present as a hang during
       the file writing time.  Previous investigations of this issue have found the model stuck
       while executing an nf90_[xxx] command; results are variable as to exactly which one.  
       The issue usually presents very early in the run (typically the first write).  Often, 
       this can be alleviated by restructuring the requested files (for instance, requesting
       fewer groups per files seems to be helpful).  Unfortunately, the sensitivity also 
       exhibits configuration case sensitivity.  

   4.  All diagnostics below are requested to be output in FLOAT (single) precision, though time
       variables and checkpoint data will remain in DOUBLE precision.
